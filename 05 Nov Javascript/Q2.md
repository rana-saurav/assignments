JavaScript and HTML are both fundamental technologies in web development, but they serve different purposes and have distinct roles. Let's explore their key differences and when you would use each.

### **1. Purpose and Role**
- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**:
  - **Purpose**: HTML is used for **structuring content** on the web. It defines the elements (like headings, paragraphs, images, links, etc.) that make up a webpage.
  - **Role**: HTML provides the **skeleton** of a web page, giving it structure and basic content. Itâ€™s not a programming language but a markup language.
  
- **JavaScript**:
  - **Purpose**: JavaScript is used for **making a webpage interactive** and dynamic. It allows you to manipulate the content, control browser behavior, and respond to user actions (like clicks, typing, etc.).
  - **Role**: JavaScript is a **programming language** that adds behavior to the page (e.g., handling form validation, updating content without reloading, animations).

### **2. Syntax**
- **HTML**:
  - HTML consists of **tags** that enclose content and provide structure. These tags are typically written with angle brackets (`< >`), and each tag usually comes in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.
  
  **Example**:
  ```html
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
  ```

- **JavaScript**:
  - JavaScript code is written in a syntax that follows programming logic, using variables, functions, loops, and conditions.
  
  **Example**:
  ```javascript
  let greeting = "Hello, World!";
  console.log(greeting);  
  ```

### **3. Execution**
- **HTML**:
  - HTML is **static** and rendered by the browser. It is loaded and displayed as it is, with no logic or behavior attached to it.
  
- **JavaScript**:
  - JavaScript is **dynamic** and executed by the browser or server. It can change the content of the page, interact with the user, or fetch data from the server while the page is still loaded (without reloading the page).

### **4. Interaction with the User**
- **HTML**:
  - HTML defines static content and structure like headings, images, buttons, and forms. However, it does not define **how** these elements interact with the user (such as clicking a button or submitting a form).

- **JavaScript**:
  - JavaScript defines the **behavior** of the page. For example, it can respond to user actions like clicking buttons, submitting forms, or moving the mouse.

### **5. Example of Usage**

#### **When to Use HTML**:
- **Structuring the Web Page**: Use HTML to define the structure of the webpage and to add elements like text, images, links, and forms.
  
**Example**: Creating a simple webpage structure with HTML:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a simple paragraph about me.</p>
    <img src="profile.jpg" alt="My Profile Picture">
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Click here to visit my blog</a>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, HTML is used to structure the webpage with a heading, a paragraph, an image, and a link.

#### **When to Use JavaScript**:
- **Interactivity**: Use JavaScript to add interactive features to the webpage such as form validation, changing content dynamically, and responding to user input without reloading the page.

**Example**: Changing the text of a button when clicked using JavaScript:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Button Click Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <button id="myButton">Click Me</button>

    <script>
        // JavaScript code to handle button click
        document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
            document.getElementById("myButton").innerText = "You Clicked Me!";
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```
