Comments are an essential part of programming because they help explain, describe, and clarify the code for anyone who reads it (including your future self). They are ignored by the JavaScript engine and do not affect the execution of the code.
```js
let age = 25;  // This variable stores the age of the person
console.log(age); // Print age to the console


/* 
   This is a multi-line comment. 
   It can span across multiple lines, making it useful for longer explanations or 
   temporarily commenting out blocks of code.
*/
let name = "Vishal";
console.log(name);  // Output the value of name
