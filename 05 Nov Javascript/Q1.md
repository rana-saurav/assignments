JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language that is primarily used for building interactive and dynamic content on websites. It is one of the core technologies of web development, alongside HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). JavaScript enables web pages to respond to user interactions, perform calculations, and update content without requiring a page reload.
