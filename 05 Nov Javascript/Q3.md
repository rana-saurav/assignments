In JavaScript, **primitive data types** are the most basic types of data that are not objects and have no methods. These types represent single values and are immutable (cannot be changed directly). There are **five** primitive data types in JavaScript:

### 1. **Number**
- **Description**: The `Number` data type represents both **integers** and **floating-point numbers** (decimals). It can represent positive, negative, and zero values, as well as special values like `NaN` (Not-a-Number) and `Infinity`.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  let integer = 42;          // An integer
  let float = 3.14;          // A floating-point number
  let negative = -100;       // A negative number
  let nanValue = NaN;        // Not-a-Number value
  let infinity = Infinity;   // Infinity value
  ```

- **Important Notes**:
  - JavaScript has only one type of `Number`, so there is no distinction between integers and floating-point numbers.
  - Special numbers like `NaN` (used when a mathematical operation fails, like `0/0`) and `Infinity` (representing an infinitely large value) are also part of the `Number` type.

### 2. **String**
- **Description**: The `String` data type is used to represent **text**. A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in either single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`), or backticks (`` ` ``) for template literals.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  let name = "John Doe";          // A string in double quotes
  let greeting = 'Hello, world!'; // A string in single quotes
  let message = `Welcome, ${name}!`; // Template literal string
  ```

- **Important Notes**:
  - Strings are **immutable**, meaning once a string is created, it cannot be modified directly (although you can manipulate the string by creating new ones).
  - Template literals (using backticks) allow for embedding variables and expressions within strings.

### 3. **Boolean**
- **Description**: The `Boolean` data type represents **logical values** and can have only two possible values: `true` or `false`.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  let isActive = true;  // Represents "true" logical value
  let isLoggedIn = false; // Represents "false" logical value
  ```

- **Important Notes**:
  - Booleans are primarily used in **conditional statements** and logic operations.
  - Other values like `0`, `""` (empty string), `null`, `undefined`, and `NaN` are treated as `false` in a boolean context.

### 4. **Undefined**
- **Description**: The `undefined` data type represents a variable that has been **declared**, but **not assigned a value**. It is automatically assigned to a variable when it is declared without being initialized.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  let a;  // Variable is declared, but not assigned any value
  console.log(a);  // Output: undefined
  ```

- **Important Notes**:
  - `undefined` is the default value for uninitialized variables and can also be explicitly assigned.
  - `undefined` is **different** from `null` (which represents the intentional absence of a value).

### 5. **Null**
- **Description**: The `null` data type represents the **intentional absence of any object value**. It is used when you want to explicitly define that a variable does not point to any object or value.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  let person = null;  // Explicitly indicates "no value" for the person variable
  console.log(person); // Output: null
  ```

- **Important Notes**:
  - `null` is often used to indicate that an object is **intentionally empty** or not set.
  - Although `null` is an object type in JavaScript, it is not considered an object in the way you might expect (and is commonly seen as a bug in JavaScript's history).
