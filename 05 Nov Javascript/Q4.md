In JavaScript, declaring variables is crucial for storing and managing data that you can later use, manipulate, and reference throughout your program.
 let keyword. let allows you to create a block-scoped variable, meaning the variable is only accessible within the block (such as a function or a loop) where it's declared.

 ```js
 let name = "Vishal";  
console.log(name);   

 ```
