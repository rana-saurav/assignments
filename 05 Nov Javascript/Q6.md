Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names is crucial for writing clean, readable, and maintainable code.
Improves Code Readability:

Well-named variables make it easier to understand what the code does, even without detailed comments. This is especially important when collaborating with other developers or when you revisit the code in the future.
Prevents Confusion:

Using vague or non-descriptive names can lead to confusion about what the variable represents. Descriptive names help to eliminate ambiguity, making it clear what kind of data is being stored or manipulated.
Makes Maintenance Easier:

Code changes and updates are much easier when variables have clear, descriptive names. If a variable is well-named, you don't have to dig into the code to figure out what it represents or how it's used.
