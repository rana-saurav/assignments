A favicon (short for "favorite icon") is a small icon associated with a website, 
typically displayed in the browser's tab, bookmarks, or address bar.
 It serves as a visual representation of the website, helping users quickly identify it among multiple tabs or in their browser history/bookmarks.

A favicon helps improve the branding of a website and contributes to the overall user experience by making the website easily recognizable. 
Favicons are usually 16x16, 32x32, or 48x48 pixels in size and can be in formats like .ico, .png, or .svg.
