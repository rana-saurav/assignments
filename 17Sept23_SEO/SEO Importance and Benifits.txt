SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It's a set of practices and strategies used to improve the visibility and ranking of a website or a webpage on search engines like Google, Bing, or Yahoo. 
The ultimate goal of SEO is to attract more organic (non-paid) traffic to a site by making it more relevant and accessible for search engines and users alike.

SEO involves several key elements, including:

1. Keyword Research: Identifying the words and phrases that people are searching for, then optimizing content around those terms.

2. On-Page SEO: Optimizing individual web pages through proper use of meta tags, headings, content structure, and ensuring it’s user-friendly.

3.Off-Page SEO: Building backlinks from other reputable websites to boost your site's authority.

4.Technical SEO: Improving the website’s technical aspects, such as site speed, mobile-friendliness, and making sure the search engines can easily crawl and index the pages.

5.Content Quality: Offering relevant, engaging, and original content that answers the users' queries.

Importance of SEO:
1. Increased Organic Traffic: Proper SEO can significantly increase the amount of visitors to your website. The higher you rank, the more likely users will click on your site.

2.Cost-Effective: Unlike paid advertising (like Google Ads), SEO brings organic traffic that doesn’t require ongoing payment. It’s an investment that keeps paying off over time.

3.Credibility and Trust: Websites that rank high on search engines are often seen as more trustworthy and authoritative by users.

4.Better User Experience: SEO not only benefits search engines but also improves the experience for users by ensuring content is relevant, easy to navigate, and loads quickly.

5.Competitive Advantage: A well-optimized website can help you stay ahead of competitors in search rankings, making it more likely that potential customers will choose you.

6. Long-Term Strategy: While SEO takes time to show results, it’s a long-term approach that can create sustainable traffic growth without ongoing ad spend.
