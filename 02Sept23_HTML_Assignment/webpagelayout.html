      "Nothing in the world can take the place of Persistence. Talent will not;
      nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not;
      unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is
      full of educated derelicts. The slogan 'Press On' has solved and always
      will solve the problems of the human race."
