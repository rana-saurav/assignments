Loops are programming constructs used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true. Loops help you avoid redundancy and make your code more efficient by repeating tasks without having to manually write the same code multiple times

Automate repetitive tasks without manually repeating the code.
Process large sets of data, such as iterating through all elements of an array or object.
Control the flow of your program in a more compact and readable way.

1. for loop
2. while loop
3. do-while loop
4. for...in loop (used for objects)
5. for...of loop (used for arrays or iterable objects)

1. for loop
The for loop is used when you know how many times you want to execute a statement or block of code.
```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i); // Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
}
```

2. while loop
The while loop is used when you want to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

```js
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log(i); // Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
    i++; // Increment i by 1
}

```

3. do-while loop
The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but the key difference is that the code block will execute at least once, regardless of the condition, because the condition is checked after the code runs.

```js
let i = 0;
do {
    console.log(i); // Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
    i++; // Increment i by 1
} while (i < 5);

```

4. for...in loop (used for objects)
The for...in loop is used to iterate over the properties of an object.
```js
let person = {
    name: "Vishal",
    age: 25,
    city: "Patna"
};

for (let key in person) {
    console.log(key + ": " + person[key]);
}
