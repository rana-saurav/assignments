Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. These statements allow you to execute specific blocks of code depending on whether a condition (expression) evaluates to true or false. They are essential for controlling the flow of the program, making decisions, and reacting to various situations.

Types of Conditional Statements in JavaScript:
1. if statement
2. if-else statement
3. else if statement
4. switch statement

1. if Statement
The if statement is the simplest form of a conditional statement. It runs a block of code if the condition is true.
```js
let age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
}

```
2. if-else Statement
The if-else statement executes one block of code if the condition is true and a different block if the condition is false.

```js
let age = 16;

if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
} else {
    console.log("You are not eligible to vote.");
}

```

3. else if Statement
The else if statement allows you to check multiple conditions. It is used when you need to check more than two conditions.
```js
let temperature = 35;

if (temperature > 30) {
    console.log("It's a hot day.");
} else if (temperature >= 20 && temperature <= 30) {
    console.log("It's a warm day.");
} else {
    console.log("It's a cold day.");
}

```
4. switch Statement
The switch statement is used to execute one of many possible blocks of code based on a value. It is an alternative to using multiple if-else if statements when there are many conditions to check

```js
let day = 3;

switch (day) {
    case 1:
        console.log("Monday");
        break;
    case 2:
        console.log("Tuesday");
        break;
    case 3:
        console.log("Wednesday");
        break;
    case 4:
        console.log("Thursday");
        break;
    case 5:
        console.log("Friday");
        break;
    case 6:
        console.log("Saturday");
        break;
    case 7:
        console.log("Sunday");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("Invalid day");
}

```
