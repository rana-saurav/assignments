1. Use Semantic HTML Elements
HTML5 introduces a number of semantic elements that help define the structure of the web page in a meaningful way. These elements provide context for screen readers and other assistive technologies, making it easier for users to navigate the content.

For example, instead of using generic <div> or <span> elements, use semantic elements like:
<header> for the page header
<nav> for navigation links
<main> for the main content of the page
<footer> for the footer content
<article> and <section> to organize content meaningfully

2. Provide Text Alternatives (Alt Text) for Images
One of the most crucial accessibility features is adding alternative text (alt text) to images, which allows users with visual impairments to understand what an image represents through screen readers.

3. Ensure Keyboard Accessibility
Keyboard navigation is essential for users who can't use a mouse due to motor impairments. HTML5 encourages the use of interactive elements like <button>, <a>, and <input> that are automatically keyboard-navigable
