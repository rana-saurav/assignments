Accessibility refers to the practice of designing and developing websites in a way that ensures all users, 
including those with disabilities, can easily navigate, interact with, and consume the content.
 This includes users with visual, auditory, motor, cognitive, and other impairments.
 Accessible web design follows guidelines and best practices to remove barriers that could prevent certain individuals from using a website effectively.

 Inclusive User Experience: Web accessibility ensures that individuals with disabilities can access the same information, services, and opportunities online as people without disabilities. By making websites accessible, we create a more inclusive digital environment for all users.

Legal Compliance: Many countries have laws (such as the Americans with Disabilities Act in the U.S. or 
the European Accessibility Act in the EU) that mandate accessibility in websites and digital platforms.
 Non-compliance could result in legal consequences, including lawsuits.

Reach a Larger Audience: Designing with accessibility in mind opens up your website to a wider audience, 
including users who may rely on assistive technologies like screen readers, voice recognition, 
or alternative input devices.

Improved Usability for All: Accessibility features often lead to improved usability for everyone. 
For example, captions on videos help not only people with hearing impairments but also users in noisy environments or 
those who prefer to watch videos silently.

SEO Benefits: Accessible websites tend to be better optimized for search engines,
 as many accessibility techniques (like adding alt text to images or ensuring proper HTML structure) also benefit SEO.
