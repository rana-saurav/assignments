1. Absolute
 The element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (i.e., an ancestor element with any position other than static). 
If no such ancestor exists,it will be positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the viewport or the <html> element).

Removed from normal document flow: This means the element does not affect the layout of other elements and is not considered part of the flow of the document.

2. Relative

 The element is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow. 
You can use the top, right, bottom, or left properties to adjust its position,
 but it will still take up space in the layout, so it affects surrounding elements.

Keeps its place in the flow: Unlike absolute, it doesn't remove the element from the document's layout. It only shifts the element from its original position.
