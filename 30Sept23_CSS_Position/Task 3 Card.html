                <h1>The Earth</h1>
                <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known celestial body to support life. With a diameter of about 12,742 kilometers, Earth is made up of several distinct layers: the solid crust, the semi-fluid mantle, the liquid outer core, and the solid inner core. It has a unique atmosphere composed primarily of nitrogen and oxygen, which allows for life to thrive. Earth's surface is 71% covered by water, with vast oceans, lakes, and rivers. Its axial tilt and rotation give rise to the cycle of day and night, while its orbit around the Sun creates the seasons. The planetâ€™s dynamic surface is shaped by plate tectonics, which causes earthquakes, volcanoes, and the formation of mountain ranges. Earth's diverse ecosystems, from rainforests to deserts, support millions of species, making it a truly unique and vibrant planet in our solar system.</p>
